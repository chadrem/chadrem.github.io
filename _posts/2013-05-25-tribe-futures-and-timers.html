<p>I've added a few missing features to <a title="Tribe" href="https://github.com/chadrem/tribe">Tribe</a>- Timers and Futures.</p>
<p><strong>Timers</strong> provide a way to tell an actor to do something in the future.  Tribe supports both one-shot and periodic timers so I believe all the major usage patterns are covered.  Adding this feature was fairly easy since all of the low level details are hidden in my <a title="Workers" href="https://github.com/chadrem/workers">Workers</a> gem.</p>
<p><strong>Futures</strong> make it easy for an actor to ask another actor to perform an operation and return the result.  Previously you would have to use custom events and a lot of boilerplate code to accomplish this.  Both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) futures are supported.  More information on both types can be found in the readme file.</p>
