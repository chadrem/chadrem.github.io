<p>
    Recently I've had a need to pick a leader instance when using AWS EC2 Auto Scaling.
    To solve this problem I've created [ec2_election](https://github.com/chadrem/ec2_election) which uses Python and AWS Lambda.
    Benefits...
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Simple:</strong>
    The code is written in Python and is hosted as an AWS Lambda function.
    This means you don't need to run any additional EC2 instances (yourself) for it to work.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Python:</strong>
    All of the code is written in simple Python 2.7 syntax since this is directly supported by AWS Lambda.
    The Boto3 SDK is used since it too is directly supported by AWS and included in AWS Lambda.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Self healing:</strong>
    AWS Cloudwatch scheduled events or EC2 Auto Scaling events are used to trigger the Lambda function.
    In both cases, highly reliable AWS infrastructure is used to elect a leader for your cluster.
