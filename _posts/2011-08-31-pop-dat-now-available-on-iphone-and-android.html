<p>Pop Dat is our latest mobile game for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pop-dat-free/id455149472">Apple iOS</a> and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bluefroggaming.popdat&amp;feature=search_result">Google Android</a>.  We're very proud of it considering it was our first hobby project.</p>
<p>It had some unique goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low cost: We had a very small budget for art and sound.  All programming was done for free in our spare time.</li>
<li>Cross platform:  We used <a href="http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/">Corona SDK</a> in order program once and deploy on multiple platforms.</li>
<li>Realistic scope: As an evenings &amp; weekends project, we had to be realistic about what we could launch in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team did a great job at driving this project to completion.  Please check it out and let us know what you think.  You can also read the official Blue Frog Gaming announcement on our <a href="http://blog.bluefroggaming.com/?p=121">blog</a>.</p>
