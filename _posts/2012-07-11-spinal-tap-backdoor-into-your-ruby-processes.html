<p>Today I released a very early/alpha version of <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/spinal_tap">Spinal Tap</a>. &nbsp;I deal with a lot of long running Ruby processes (crons, daemons, etc) and I occassionally need to debug them while they are running. &nbsp;Thus Spinal Tap was born. &nbsp;The future vision includes statistics tracking, custom defined commands, and much more. &nbsp;Think of it as a backdoor into your Ruby processes :-) &nbsp;Thanks go to my good friend <a href="http://crunchtools.com/">Scott McCarty</a> for brainstorming the long term vision of the project.</p>
