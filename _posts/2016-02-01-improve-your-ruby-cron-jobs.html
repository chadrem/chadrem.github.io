<p>
    I've released my latest Ruby gem named <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/cron_helper">Cron Helper</a>
    to make life easier for those Ruby & Rails projects that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">Cron</a>.
    It's designed to build on top of the <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">Whenever</a>
    gem to solve a number of common problems I've encountered over the years.
    Features include:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Overlapping job prevention:</strong>
    Cron will allow overlapping jobs and this can result in race conditions, resource starvation, and other problems
    since web developers usually don't encounter them on their development environments.
    An example of this is an hourly job that starts taking two hours to complete.
    Cron Helper uses file locking to prevent overlapping jobs since the general rule of thumb is that a longer running
    job is a better situation to have than a buildup of overlapping jobs.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tasks:</strong> Think of tasks as methods you want to execute when a specific job runs (such as an hourly job).
    Tasks give you guaranteed ordering within a job.
    They also give you exception handling so that a failed task won't prevent the tasks after it from executing.
    This gives you fine grained control of how and when code should execute in a job.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Productivity:</strong> Traditionally, creating cron jobs was a sysadmin task on a server.
    One of the great advantanges of the <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">Whenever</a> gem is that it gave
    this capability to the app developer by making it a first class concept in Rails.
    Cron Helper builds on on top of this by helping to prevent developers from shooting themselves in the foot.
    Typically an app has a few crons on a specific schedule (hourly, weekly, daily, etc).
    Once these schedules are created, a developer can simply register a new task in an existing job.
    Their new task will be isolated from other tasks on the same schedule.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Logging:</strong> Cron Helper makes it easy to capture all output in a job (stderr & stdout) and
    decide what to do with it.
    You have the freefrom to log it locally, send it to a remote service, or simply print it to stdout (the default behavior).
    Since it's written in Ruby, you also have the power to manipulate it, use regular expressions, or write any other custom
    logic that your project requires.
