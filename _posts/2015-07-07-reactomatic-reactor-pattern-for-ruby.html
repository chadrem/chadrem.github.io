<p><a href="https://github.com/chadrem/reactomatic">Reactomatic</a> is an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern">Reactor Pattern</a> for Ruby.  It provides an <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/">EventMachine</a> inspired interface for working with TCP/IP sockets in an asynchronous way.  Low level IO is provided by the <a href="https://github.com/celluloid/nio4r">nio4r</a> gem so it works well on both MRI and JRuby.  Design goals include thread safety and minimalist API.  Reactomatic wants to do one thing and do it well on all supported platforms.  This means many common EventMachine features aren't included such as application level protocols, timers, and thread pools.</p>
