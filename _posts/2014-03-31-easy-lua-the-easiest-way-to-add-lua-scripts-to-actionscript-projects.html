<p>This past weekend I released a new open source project called <a title="Easy Lua" href="https://github.com/chadrem/easy_lua">Easy Lua</a>.  It's a wrapper around the Lua port that is included in Adobe's open source <a title="CrossBridge" href="https://github.com/adobe-flash/crossbridge">CrossBridge</a> project.  It lets you easily integrate Lua scripts into any ActionScript project (Flash, AIR, etc) with a minimum of headache and zero knowledge of Lua's C API.</p>
<p>CrossBridge is an amazing piece of technology that unfortunately receives little press.  In summary, it combines GCC with FreeBSD's libc and allows you to compile C/C++ code to ABC bytecode.  Since ABC is the native bytecode for Adobe Flash and AIR, you end up with a version of Lua that can fully integrate with all of Adobe's runtimes (mobile, desktop, and web).</p>
<p>The main use case for Easy Lua is to add Lua scripts to ActionScript based games.  I plan on using it to implement card game engines in Lua so that the engine can be used both on the client (single-player mode) and on the server (mutli-player mode).  This will mean less development time, more code reuse, and hopefully fewer bugs.</p>
