<p>A few months back, my friend Mike and I build <a href="https://github.com/BlueFrogGaming/fiona">Fiona</a>.&nbsp; We're calling it a "configuration data engine" since we use it store various kinds of template data in our games.&nbsp; Our template data includes settings, entity properties, maps, and assets.&nbsp; With Fiona, all of this data can easily be stored in a single database table.&nbsp; All templates and associated properties are stored in two tables using STI.&nbsp; Data is easy to backup/restore and customize per environment.&nbsp; The gem is still in the early stages, but the foundation is there.&nbsp; As time permits we'll increase test coverage and the feature set.</p>
