<p>Today I released <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/market_bot">Market Bot</a>.&nbsp; Features include a simple Ruby API and high performance thanks to the Nokogiri and Typhoeus gems.&nbsp; It also has relatively good test coverage using rspec.&nbsp; More information including examples, benchmarks, and source code can be found on my github account.</p>
