<p>Recently I've created two new Ruby gems known as <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/workers" title="Workers">Workers</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/tribe" title="Tribe">Tribe</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/workers" title="Workers">Workers</a> gem turns low-level operating system threads into simple to use event-driven workers and worker pools. &nbsp;This allows you to focus on message passing instead of complex thread management. &nbsp;As an added bonus, it includes a timer system that can tell your workers to execute work in the future.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/tribe" title="Tribe">Tribe</a> gem builds on top of Workers in order to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" title="actor model">actor model</a>. It specifically focuses on event-driven actors such that each thread manages one or more actors. &nbsp;This way the system can support many more actors than is possible with implementations that force a 1:1 thread to actor relationship. &nbsp;A simple benchmark demonstrating one million actors using 20 threads can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/chadrem/tribe/wiki/Performance" title="performance">performance</a> wiki page.</p>
<p>Both gems have been tested with MRI Ruby 1.9.3 and JRuby 1.7. &nbsp;Due to MRI's thread limitations, it is highly recommended that you use JRuby if you are concerned about multi-core CPU performance.</p>
