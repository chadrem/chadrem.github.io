<p>Recently I put together two new Ruby gems called <a title="Tribe EM" href="https://github.com/chadrem/tribe_em">Tribe EM</a> and <a title="Tribe EM AMF Socket" href="https://github.com/chadrem/tribe_em_amfsocket">Tribe EM AMF Socket</a>.  Both gems build on top of my <a title="Tribe" href="https://github.com/chadrem/tribe">Tribe</a> gem.</p>
<p>Tribe EM bridges the gap between Tribe and <a title="EventMachine" href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/">EventMachine</a>.  Currently it provides basic TCP server functionality for Tribe actors.  My intent is to use this as a base for implementing higher-level protocols such as HTTP.</p>
<p>Tribe EM AMF Socket is a wrapper around my existing <a title="AMF Socket - Ruby" href="https://github.com/chadrem/amf_socket_ruby">AMF Socket - Ruby</a> gem.  Currently it only supports messages and not requests (RPC).  I believe this to be a reasonable limitation for now since AMF Socket messages fit in very well with Tribe's asynchronous messaging system.</p>
<p>One key difference between the two gems is what I refer to as native vs wrapper implementations:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Native</span>: The Tribe::EM::Connection class is considered native since it pushes the higher level protocol implementation onto the actor threads.  This results in greater scalability since actors take advantage of multi-core systems (especially on JRuby).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Wrapper</span>: The Tribe::EM::AmfSocket::Connection class is considered a wrapper since it wraps the AMF Socket gem for use with Tribe.  This means that a lot of work (serialization, deserialization, framing, keep alives, etc) are all performed on the EventMachine thread.  The result is lower performance than a native implementation, but less coding since I can reuse the existing Ruby implementation of AMF Socket.</p>
<p>Both gem are designed to be easily customized.  Feel free to contact me with your custom protocol implementations so that I can add them to the Tribe EM homepage.</p>
