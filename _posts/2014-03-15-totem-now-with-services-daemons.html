<p>As mentioned in my previous post, <a title="Totem" href="https://github.com/chadrem/totem">Totem</a> is a new Ruby project generator that I've put together.  One major missing feature was the ability to easily create services (also known as background processes or daemons).  To solve this problem, I have created an add-on gem called <a title="Raad - Totem" href="https://github.com/chadrem/raad_totem">Raad - Totem</a>.  It is a fork of the original <a title="Raad" href="https://github.com/colinsurprenant/raad">Raad</a> gem with a number of customizations to integrate it with a Totem project.  Much thanks go to the original Raad authors since they were able to make it work for both Ruby and JRjuby.</p>
